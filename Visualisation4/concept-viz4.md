# Concept visualisation 4 - Born This Way

Work process:
  - Show all the known diseases/characteristics from the file
  - Draw the visualisation for each of those characterisctics
  - Add a click event to show the visualisation
  

Goal:
  - Visualize what kind of things you can already know about a random person by only seeing his or her DNA
  

Attributes:
  - Exploratory
  - D3
  - Interactive
  
Data from: 
  - DNA from Manu Sporny: https://data.world/adamhelsinger/a-human-dna-sequence
  - RS from: https://www.snpedia.com/
  
Disclaimer: The diseases and characteristics shown are far from all the things you can already know from someones DNA, but that data was a lot to find, so I decided to limit this visualisation with amounts shown. Also, not all of these diseases are determined by one RS, so to make it easier for myself I removed duplicates, which in turn means the data isn't 100% accurate
