# Concept visualisation 1

Work process: 
  - Collect the top 25 charts of each country on iTunes, Spotify or another site if I couldn't find it there
  - Collect the lyrics of all those songs for each country/region
  - Decide the colour of the country/region based on the most popular genre
  - Count each word in the song lyrics using https://www.databasic.io/en/wordcounter/ and https://www.online-utility.org/text/analyzer.jsp
  - Put each word on a vector image of the world (found here: https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/world-map-blue-template_718596.htm#term=world&page=1&position=19) and decrease the size of each word as the popularity of the word decreases
  
  
Goal:
  - Visualising the popularity of music genres and the most used words in music for each country
  

Attributes:
  - Explanatory
  - Static
