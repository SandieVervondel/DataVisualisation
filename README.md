# Data Visualisation - Sandie Vervondel
# 2018-2019


Visualisation 1 - Around the world  
A map of the world where each country is made up of the most used words in the top 25 songs 
Data collected during the period of November 4th 2018 to December 7th 2018 on various music charting websites (iTunes, spotify, ...)

Visualisation 2 - Money money money  
A data sonification using the real-time currency exchange rates

Visualisation 3 - Monster mash  
A physical 'bar' chart showing the top 20 most represented Doctor Who villains in the first 50 years (1963-2013) of the show. The bars of the chart are 3D-printed models of the villains.

Visualisation 4 - Born This Way  
What do we know about this random stranger based on his DNA? This visualisation shows exactly that! Made using D3, you can find out which things (like eye colour, lactose intolerancy, ...) I was able to discover about Manu Sporny based purely on his DNA.

Visualisation 5 - The Circle of Life  
A visualisation representing how much money Disney earned at the box office (in the country where the movie was made) when you take the inflation into account.
