# Concept visualisation 5 - The Circle of Life  

Work process:
  - Load the data in Processing
  - Make a class so that the data can be stored in instances of that class
  - Map the gross values so that they are usable as radius
  - Make sure that each iteration of the draw function shows only 1 year
  - Change the colour of the circle depending on the genre of the movie
  - Make a line and some texts to make the data readable
  - Change time interval depending on amount of movies per year
  

Goal:
  - Visualize how much Disney has made on each of its movies as if they were released in 2016 (inflation)
  

Attributes:
  - Explanatory
  - Linear
