# Concept visualisation 3

Work process:
  - Creating the models I couldn't find online myself, or adapting some of the ones I found. The models I used for this visualisation were  found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:155208. The models I made myself are: Auton, BlackGuardian, Borusa, Cyberleader, Cybermat, DalekSupreme, GreatIntelligence, MadameKavorian, Roboform
  - Calculating the height of each print when the biggest one is 80mm tall and the shortest is 40mm.
  - 3D printing for many, many hours
  - Designing a police line-up type background so that I can lasercut these. The design consists of lines that are 1cm apart and shows the corresponding values for that line (the height on the left and the amount of stories* on the right)
  - Designing cards for each villain that shows its rank, name and amount of stories
  
*I decided to go with the stories and not the individual episodes since the earliest episodes almost always consisted out of at least 3 parts

Goal:
  - Try to show which villains make up most of the show
  

Attributes:
  - Explanatory
  - 3D
  - Physical
